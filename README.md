### Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK (version 3.0 or later)
- Dart SDK (version 2.17 or later)
- Android Studio / VS Code with Flutter and Dart plugins
- Android SDK / Xcode (for iOS development)

### Basic Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/JS-Aakash/Quantum-Shop---Flutter-Project.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd Quantum-Shop---Flutter-Project
   ```

3. Check Flutter installation:
   ```
   flutter doctor
   ```



## Steps to Run the Project

Since the repository is missing essential Flutter project files, follow these steps to set up and run the project:

### Step 1: Create a New Flutter Project

```
flutter create quantum_shop
cd quantum_shop
```

This will create a new Flutter project with all the necessary files and directories.

### Step 2: Copy the Existing Code

1. Clone the original repository (if you haven't already):
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/JS-Aakash/Quantum-Shop---Flutter-Project.git
   ```

2. Copy the `lib/` directory from the cloned repository to your new project:
   ```
   cp -r Quantum-Shop---Flutter-Project/lib/* quantum_shop/lib/
   ```

### Step 3: Update pubspec.yaml

Open the `pubspec.yaml` file in your new project and add all identified dependencies to the `dependencies` section. For example:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  cupertino_icons: ^1.0.2
  provider: ^6.0.5
  http: ^0.13.5
  shared_preferences: ^2.0.18
  cached_network_image: ^3.2.3
  fluttertoast: ^8.2.2
  # Add other dependencies as needed
```

Also, add any assets used in the app:

```yaml
flutter:
  uses-material-design: true
  assets:
    - assets/images/
    - assets/fonts/
    # Add other asset paths as needed
```

### Step 4: Install Dependencies

Run the following command to install the dependencies:

```
flutter pub get
```

### Step 5: Set Up Assets

1. Create an `assets/` directory in the project root:
   ```
   mkdir -p assets/images assets/fonts
   ```

2. Add any images, fonts, or other assets used in the app to these directories.

3. Make sure to reference these assets in `pubspec.yaml` as shown in Step 4.

### Step 6: Configure Platform-Specific Settings

**Android Configuration**:

1. Open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Add necessary permissions, such as internet access:
   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
   ```
3. Update the application name, icon, and other settings as needed.

**iOS Configuration**:

1. Open `ios/Runner/Info.plist`.
2. Add necessary permissions and configurations.
3. Update the display name, bundle identifier, and other settings as needed.

### Step 7: Set Up Backend Services

If the app connects to a backend API:

1. Locate the API service files in the `lib/services/` directory.
2. Update the base URL and endpoints to match your backend.
3. Set up any authentication services if required.

### Step 8: Run the App

1. Connect a device or start an emulator/simulator.
2. Run the app:
   ```
   flutter run
   ```

### Step 9: Test the App

1. Test on different devices and screen sizes.
2. Verify all features work as expected.
3. Check for any performance issues or bugs.
